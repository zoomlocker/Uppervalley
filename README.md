## 1. Introduction

The enhanced UVDS Leachate Basin Capacity web application assists in more detailed calculations of the leachate basin's capacity. It now includes anticipated rainfall impact, leading to more dynamic and accurate management of the basin's capacity.

## 2. Features

- **Depth Gauge and Rainfall Input**: Accepts numerical inputs for both the depth gauge reading and anticipated rainfall.
- **Cumulative Volume and Anticipated Impact**: Calculates the current volume and estimates the increase in volume due to anticipated rainfall.
- **Remaining Capacity and New Volume Post-Rainfall**: Determines the available capacity and forecasts new volume post-rainfall.
- **Enhanced Visual Representation**: An updated pie chart visually represents current, remaining, and post-rainfall volumes.
- **Data Validation Reminder**: Continues to advise users to validate the data, especially after structural or topographical changes.

## 3. How to Use

1. Access the UVDS Leachate Basin Capacity website.
2. Enter the depth gauge reading and anticipated rainfall in their respective fields.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. View the updated cumulative volume, remaining capacity, anticipated depth increase, and new volume after rainfall, displayed both in cubic feet and gallons.
5. Refer to the pie chart for a comprehensive visual breakdown of the data.

## 4. Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, & JavaScript: For the web application's structure, style, and interactive features.
- Google Charts: Enhanced for dynamic pie chart visualizations.

## 5. Advanced Calculations & Interpolation

The application now includes a more sophisticated interpolation method and data points to calculate volumes at varying depths and rainfall predictions. This provides more accurate and situation-specific data for basin management.

## 6. Further Development

Potential future updates include:

- **Real-Time Weather Integration**: Incorporating live weather data to predict changes in basin volume.
- **User Customization**: Allowing users to input specific basin parameters for tailored calculations.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Optimizing the site for mobile device usage.
